# WebsocketTestApp

This repository is an Android App to test how to setup a websocket connection to receive push notifications that will work in background, even on newer android systems with background restrictions and no firebase cloud messaging.

This is just a prototype project and therefore the code won't be clean and may contain unnecessary steps/code or even errors.
